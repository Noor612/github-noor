### Titanic Machine Learning from Disater
>The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.  This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

#### Data Handling, Analysis and Visualizations
*   `Import data with pandas`
*   `Combine Train and Test`
*   `append function to combine both files` this exercise reduces the coding as you are applying all functions only once (on the combined      file), the hustle to do it separately on both files vanishes.
*   `Clean Data and replace null values with best of Mean,Median or mode.`
*   `Visualizations through Matplolib` used histograms

#### Data Modelling and Evaluation
*    Supervised Machine learning Techniques:
*    `Logit Regression Model`
